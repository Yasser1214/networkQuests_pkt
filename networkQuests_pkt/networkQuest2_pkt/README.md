#################### Network quest 2 : OSPFv2 ####################


Two desktop VLANs are connected to each other and to a server LAN by 4 successive routers working with the OSPFv2 protocol wich means that information will circulate on the shortest path in terms of transfer speed. Both VLANs share the same gateway thanks to a method called "router on stick". The method allows to divide a gateway into two "sub gateways". A crypted password protects all the network equipement. The switch ports are configured to allow only one communication at time. The server is configured to forbid the access to PC2.

#################### Cisco Packet Tracer Network project : Lan, Vlan, RIPv2 and OSPFv2 protocols ####################


This folder includes two Cisco Packet Tarcer projects :
	- A Desktop LAN connected to a Server LAN by the RIPv2 protocol.
	- Two Desktop VLANs connected to each other and to a Server LAN by the OSPFv2 protocol. Both VLANs communicate through the same gateway thanks to the "router on stick" method.
